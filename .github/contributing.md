### Reduced test case required

All bug reports and problem issues require a [**reduced test case**](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/). Create one by forking any one of the [CodePen examples](https://codepen.io/desandro/pens/tags/?grid_type=list&selected_tag=packery-docs) from [the docs](https://packery.metafizzy.co).

**CodePens**

+ [Fluid layout](https://codepen.io/desandro/pen/xZjOXq)
+ [Images](https://codepen.io/desandro/pen/pgVbLv)
+ [Draggable](https://codepen.io/desandro/pen/aGvIq)

**Test cases**

+ A reduced test case clearly demonstrates the bug or issue.
+ It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.
+ A link to your production site is **not** a reduced test case.

Providing a reduced test case is the best way to get your issue addressed. Without a reduced test case, your issue may be closed.

## Pull requests

Contributions are welcome!

+ **For typos and one-line fixes,** send those right in.
+ **For larger features,** open an issue before starting any significant work. Let's discuss to see how your feature fits within Packery's vision.
+ **Follow the code style.** Spaces in brackets, semicolons, trailing commas.
+ **Do not edit `packery.pkgd.js`.** Make your edits to source files in `js/`.
+ **Do not run `gulp` to update `dist/` files.** I'll take care of this when I create a new release.

Your code will be used as part of a commercial product if merged. By submitting a Pull Request, you are giving your consent for your code to be integrated into Packery as part of a commercial product.
